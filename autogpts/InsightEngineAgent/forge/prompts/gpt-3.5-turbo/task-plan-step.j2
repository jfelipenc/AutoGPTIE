{% block prompt %}
The current date is {{ date }}. Your original task is:

{{ task }}

Answer in the provided format.

Your job is to decompose the original task into smaller, more manageable and executable sub-tasks using a hierarchical approach. You should break the task into
a tree-like structure and keep it ordered by order of execution. All your tasks involves generating graphs to be used in CanvasJS. You must always create one task for extracting data,
one or multiple tasks for processing the data and one task for generating the graph. You can create as many sub-tasks as you want, but you must always have at least one sub-task for each of the three.

Make each subtask executable by one of the abilities available, but do NOT preselect the ability or mention it. Always choose the path with least sub-tasks.
